# Exceeds spec
## The analysis produces the expected output
I produced the expected figure, with updated aesthetics to allow for easier reading. Additionally, I adjusted the 

## The code is appropriately commented
I used commenting to keep track of steps I took during my cleaning and analysis and why I took those steps. I commented throughout my analysis script, function script, and quarto doc. 

# Collaboration
For my peer review, I gave feedback to Sofia S. It was slightly challenging to give constructive feedback because her quarto doc was still under construction, so I did not see the results. However, I was able to provide some insight on sourcing the function she used, and calling her named object that she referenced which would assist with producing a rendered quarto doc. Additionally, I assisted her with ggplot code that would facet her figure the way she wanted and add a line denoting hurricane date.

# Instructor feedback

## Automate

[M] **Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**

[M] The analysis runs without errors

[M] **The analysis produces the expected output**

- You did so good! But your description of the exceeds spec cuts off mid sentence, so I'm not sure what you meant.

[M] **Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**

## Organize

[M] Raw data is contained in its own folder

[M] Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

[M] **At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file**

## Document

[M] The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

[M] **The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**

[E] **The code is appropriately commented**

- The code comments in rolling-mean-function.r are especially good!

[M] **Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention**

## Scale

After cloning the repo on Workbench:

[M] Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages

[M] The analysis script runs without errors

## Collaborate

[M] **The student has provided attentive, constructive feedback in a peer review**

[M] **The student has contributed to a peer's repo by opening an issue and creating a pull request**

[M] The repo has at least three closed GitHub issues

[M] The commit history includes at least one merged branch and a resolved merge conflict

[M] The rendered analysis is accessible via GitHub Pages
